# sign_language_to_text
The aim of this project is to build a tool for the people who is unable to  here or speak. It should be modest, easy to use and recognize a user  gestures with a highest degree of accuracy, so that user do not have to  repeat themselves often, which can be annoying. The algorithm used to  detect gestures is. Using this Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) for gesture  recognition and recognized gesture is converted into text. This algorithm  will explains to model the difference between the classes of data. The  gesture recognition using LDA algorithm that involves two phases training  phase and recognition phase The final outputs are good and gesture can be recognize accurately and  can be convert into text
